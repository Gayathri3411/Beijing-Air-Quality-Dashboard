## 1. Project Title
**Beijing Air Quality Analysis – Interactive Power BI Dashboard**

---

## 2. Description
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive analysis of Beijing’s air quality by visualizing key pollutant levels, temperature trends, and humidity variations across multiple months. The report transforms complex environmental data into meaningful insights, enabling users to understand seasonal air quality patterns, pollutant fluctuations, and the weather conditions that impact pollution levels. Using intuitive visuals such as bar charts, KPI cards, line graphs, and interactive slicers, the dashboard highlights essential environmental indicators including Ozone, Indium Oxide, Sulphur, Benzene, CO(GT), Nitrous Oxide, and Nitrogen Dioxide. It also identifies key metrics such as the hottest day and most humid day captured in the dataset. This project showcases strong analytical storytelling, data modeling proficiency, and advanced Power BI visualization skills—making it well-suited for environmental research, academic analysis, professional reporting, and portfolio display.
